**Acceptance of American users** <br>
The company has had exceptional acceptance of its products in the American market, which is confirmed with a Net Promoter Score (NPS) indicator of over 8 among its customers.

The positive response to MiniLift in the USA is as a result of several factors, including:
- The growing market for **individual accessibility**, driven by the elderly and the disabled, and US Veterans.
- Population dispersion and the large number of two-story houses;
- The major advantage of excellent value for money and benefits when compared to the other individual accessibility options available in the market. <br><br>

This means that there will be substancial growth for home accessibility options throughout the USA and the Minilift line will be in much grather demand in the coming years, promising exceptional growth opportuninies for Exxponential LLC. <br><br>

**Safety Standards** <br>
**User safety** is the main concern of the Minilift engineering team. Minilift elevators meet **all American vertical accessibility standards**. In particular, the Minilift line fits to the **DoJ's ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)** ruled by the **2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design**.

The "2010 ADA Standards" set the minimum requirements -both scoping and technical- for *"newly designed and constructed or altered State and local government facilities, public accommodations, and commercial facilities to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities"*. <br><br>

**Minilift installation** <br>
The installation of a Minilift elevator is a very quick and simple operation. The **civil work** to prepare for the installation of the equipment is also very simple.

The execution of the civli work is the client's responsibility and basically consists of:
- Drill a square hole between the two floors served by Minilift;
- Install a 220V power supply (the same type as the electric power sources for air conditioning equipment).

During the execution of civil works, **clients receive technical advice** with all the necessary guidelines for contracting the services of the **contractors**.

The installation often involves some **logistical complexity** when it requires **travel** and **accommodation** for technicians throughout the United States. <br> <br>

Usualy, the payment is divided into three installments. The first installment is paid upon closing the contract, a second installment is paid on delivery of the equipment to the customer's home and a last installment is paid at the end of the installation of the equipment.

<br>

**Do It Yourself - DIY** <br>
Significant part of the final price of the equipment is a result of the aggregate cost to **install** the equipment. So we have researching viable ways to **adapt the current project** of the MiniLift line to the DIY modality and, thus, considerably reduce the price of the equipment to the final consumer.

The Minilift DIY line distribution strategy will use **authorized distributors** in the USA, including **retail stores**, **contractors** and **architects**.

Despite the focus on distributing the DIY model in retail stores, the new company intends to continue selling the elevator line in the traditional way, that is, it will continue to carry out installations and technical assistance for the equipment throughout the USA.<br>
