**Acceptance of American users** <br>
The company has found very good acceptance of the equipment in the American market, which can be confirmed with a Net Promoter Score (NPS) indicator above 8 among its users and customers. 

The good reception of MiniLift in the USA is explained by several factors, among them:
- The growing market for **individual accessibility**, driven by the **elderly** and the **disabled**, including veterans of war;
- Population dispersion and high incidence of **two-story houses**;
- The excellent relationship between **price** and benefit, when compared to the other individual accessibility options available on the market. <br> <br>

<br> 

All of these factors point to a promising growth of Exxponential LLC and an increasing **popularization of the concept** of accessibility of the MiniLift line in the coming years. <br><br>

**Safety standards** <br>
User safety is Minilift's primary concern. Minilift line elevators meet all American vertical accessibility standards. In particular, the Minilift line fits into the DoJ's ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) and the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design "2010 Standards" or "Standards".

The 2010 Standards set minimum requirements - both scoping and technical - for newly designed and constructed or altered State and local government facilities, public accommodations, and commercial facilities to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. <br><br>

**Installation** <br>
Installing Minilift is a very quick and simple operation. The civil work to prepare for the installation of the equipment is also very simple.

The execution of the civli work is the client's responsibility and basically consists of:
- Drill a square hole between the two floors served by Minilift;
- Install a 220V power supply (the same type as the electric power sources for air conditioning equipment).

During the execution of civil works, clients receive technical advice with all the necessary guidelines for contracting the services of the contractors.

Eventually, the installation requires **travel** and **accommodation** of technicians, especially for the interior regions of the states. Some states also require prior license applications from city governments.<br> <br>

<br>

**Price and commercial conditions** <br>
The prices for Minilift two-stop lifts basically depend on the size of the cab. It is possible to order from a Minilift lift with a cab for a single person to two people plus a wheelchair.

The lowest-priced model costs around $ 15,000.

The values are divided into three installments. The first installment is paid upon closing the contract, a second installment is paid on delivery of the equipment to the customer's home and a last installment is paid at the end of the installation of the equipment.

The commissioning of dealers and resellers is paid in the same proportion as the division of the installments.

### What's next

**New Minilift design** <br>
In response to our customers' requests, we are developing a new design for the cabins of the Minilift product line. The new cabs will soon be available for sale.<br><br>

<br>

**Do It Yourself - DIY** <br>
Significant part of the final price of the equipment is a result of the aggregate cost to **install** the equipment. So we have researching viable ways to **adapt the current project** of the MiniLift line to the DIY modality and, thus, considerably reduce the price of the equipment to the final consumer.

The Minilift DIY line distribution strategy will use **authorized distributors** in the USA, including **retail stores**, **contractors** and **architects**.

Despite the focus on distributing the DIY model in retail stores, the new company intends to continue selling the elevator line in the traditional way, that is, it will continue to carry out installations and technical assistance for the equipment throughout the USA.<br>
